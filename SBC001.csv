131.39,131.59,",",yeah
131.59,131.93,.,i bet
131.59,131.96,",",and then
131.99,133.19,",",so we had to know these tendons
133.19,133.87,",",and ligaments
133.87,134.66,",",and then
134.66,135.75,",",all the bones

136.88,137.41,",",you know
137.41,139.09,",",all the way up- from the shoulder down

152.07,153.27,",",th- there's a white line
153.27,153.83,",",that you go by
153.83,155.47,",",and a horse has this little white line
157.12,158.59,?,with the hoof knife
158.59,158.9,?,you know
159.56,161.21,?,and then you can see this little white line
161.21,162.81,",",and that's kinda where you go by
163.16,163.72,",",you know
163.72,164.62,",",the horse kinda helps you out
164.62,165.02,",",because it
166.65,167.05,.,mhm
167.65,169.44,",",kinda need a little guide
169.44,170.46,.,of where you trim
170.46,171.76,",",and
171.76,173.85,.,i am still scared to do it
173.85,174.44,",",because
174.44,175.02,",",you know
175.02,175.52,",",i mean
175.52,177.24,",",you can make a horse go lame
177.24,178.47,.,by doing it
178.23,178.44,.,really
178.47,179.89,.,well you can trim em too short
179.89,181.06,",",and make em
181.06,181.32,",",you know
181.32,182.62,",",and they're just a little bit
183.06,184.3,",",the first couple of days
184.3,184.67,",",you know
184.67,186.22,.,i mean they're just sore
186.22,187.39,",",that's not bad
187.39,188.78,.,but sometimes you can get it really bad
188.78,190.75,.,you can really make a horse really bad
191.89,192.59,",",you know then
192.59,193.3,",",they have to
193.3,193.7,",",like
193.7,195.72,",",keep em
195.72,197.43,",",away from anything
197.43,197.73,",",you know
197.73,199.41,",",get em really in the soft ground
199.41,199.66,",",and
199.66,201.12,",",no hard pebbles
201.12,202.91,?,or hard clods of dirt or anything
202.91,204.03,",",so
204.03,206.35,.,(hx) i don't know
206.35,208.55,.,i'm a little scared about doing it yet
208.55,208.94,",",you know
208.94,210.06,.,i get em really long
210.06,211.16,.,i mean they're still long
211.16,212.26,",",when i get done with them
212.26,213.58,",",a lot of times
213.58,214.41,",",like i'll get done
214.41,215.21,",",and i'll think i'm done
215.76,217.18,",",look down at the horse's hoof
217.18,217.96,",",and it's still
217.96,219.01,.,it's too long
219.01,220.41,",",and then like
220.41,221.81,",",i would never
221.81,222.42,",",ever
222.42,222.86,",",ever
222.86,223.76,",",trust myself
223.76,224.96,.,to shoe a horse
224.96,226.02,.,see we did that too
226.33,228.13,.,we did a lot of stuff
229.22,230.07,",",like we had the
230.07,230.47,",",um
230.47,231.97,?,the burners
231.97,232.31,",",you know
233.69,235.54,?,you started out with the straight iron
235.54,236.39,?,you know
236.39,238.09,",",and you'd stick it into the
238.09,238.85,",",into the
238.85,239.65,",",you know like
239.65,241.05,.,actual blacksmithing
241.05,243.4,",",and you'd put it into the hot coals
243.4,243.8,?,you know
243.8,244.45,",",and then
244.8,245.79,",",i- i- straight bar
246.39,247.38,",",a horseshoe out of it
247.38,247.88,?,you know
247.88,248.73,",",but
248.97,251.37,.,these shoes we never did put on a horse
251.37,254.12,",",we just put the shoes that were already made
254.12,255.1,.,on a horse
255.1,256.7,.,and that's as far as we got
256.7,256.97,",",i mean
256.97,258.67,",",if you would really get into it
258.67,260.22,",",well as a matter of fact
260.22,261.37,.,this is really funny
261.37,261.62,",",you know
261.62,265.18,.,there isn't really any girl farriers around anywhere
265.43,265.73,?,farrier
265.73,266.37,.,th- yeah
266.37,267.78,.,farrier is what they're called
268.78,270.93,",",the reason they were showing us this at college
270.93,271.62,",",was just
271.62,272.52,",",to get us
272.52,274.34,",",to know if our trimmer
274.34,276.15,",",and shoer weres doing it right
276.28,278.47,.,plus the knowledge of knowing the bones and ligaments
278.47,279.07,",",which we
279.07,280.8,.,we had it in another class too
281.1,282.85,",",that was kind of a double thing that
283.55,284.8,",",in another class
284.8,286.16,.,so it was kinda review for us
286.16,287.53,",",well it was a review for some people
287.53,289.02,.,depend on what time of the year you took it
289.02,289.4,.,you know
289.4,290.96,.,if it was a review or not
290.96,291.61,",",but
291.61,293.08,",",anyway
293.08,293.47,",",um
293.47,296.77,.,what was i gonna say
297.67,299.69,",",you said you never made the horseshoes
298.42,298.81,.,gonna say
299.69,299.9,",",but
299.9,301.07,",",well
301.07,302.07,",",w- um
302.07,304.37,",",when we put em on a horse's hoof
304.37,305.22,",",all we do
305.22,306.88,.,they're already made
306.88,307.93,.,they're round
307.93,309.43,.,we pick out a size
309.43,309.85,",",you know we'd
309.85,311.11,",",like look at the horse's hoof
311.11,311.44,",",and say
311.44,311.98,",",okay
311.98,313.43,.,this is a double-aught
313.43,314.43,.,this is an aught
314.43,315.23,",",this is
315.23,315.67,.,you know
316.12,317.05,.,what size
317.05,318.1,",",and double-aught and aught
318.1,319.8,.,are the ones that are most popular
319.8,321.51,",",for
321.51,322.21,",",you know
322.21,323.13,.,the light horse
323.13,323.32,",",you know
323.32,323.63,",",i mean
323.63,325.02,",",you get into the big horses
325.22,326.52,",",like the clydesdales
326.52,326.97,",",shires
327.37,328.32,.,a whole different thing
328.32,329.12,",",or ponies
329.12,330.02,.,that's a whole different thing
330.02,331.52,",",but we're talking just the regular
331.52,332.62,.,light horses you know
332.62,333.71,",",and
334.36,334.87,",",uh aught
334.87,335.52,",",and double-aught
335.52,336.62,.,are the two sizes
336.62,337.32,",",well anyway
338.17,338.65,",",okay
338.65,339.75,.,this is after you trimmed em
339.75,341.55,",",and you go get your shoe
341.55,342.4,.,it's already made
342.4,343.27,.,it's already round
343.27,344.25,.,you pick out your size
344.25,345.62,",",you go look
345.62,347.7,.,and every horse's hoof is shaped different
347.7,348.39,.,it doesn't matter
348.39,350.81,.,every horse is gonna have a little different shape
350.81,352.94,",",and so what you have to do
352.57,353.42,",",every uh
354.53,355.62,?,custom-made for the horse then
355.62,356.37,.,no no
356.37,357.22,.,no
357.47,358.32,",",what we do
358.32,360.34,.,then that's that's where the ferrier comes in
360.34,361.86,",",every shoe
361.86,362.44,",",is like
362.44,363.88,",",you get- order
363.88,364.28,",",you know
364.28,366.65,.,i would like a b- case of double-aught shoes
367.1,368.45,.,the ferrier gets em
368.45,368.85,",",you know
368.85,369.75,",",that's the way it goes
369.75,370.75,",",and then
370.75,372.28,",",our job
372.28,373.68,",",is to shape the shoe
373.68,374.98,.,to the horse's foot
374.98,376.55,",",and that
376.55,378.0,",",it d- it sounds easy
378.0,379.4,.,but it's really hard to do
379.4,379.82,",",i mean
379.82,381.65,",",some of em you have to
381.65,382.2,",",you know
382.2,382.64,",",like say
382.64,382.92,",",okay
382.92,384.57,?,say your shoe's like this
384.57,387.87,?,and your horse's foot is just really wide or something
387.87,389.43,",",well then you have to put it on the anvil
389.43,391.02,",",and get the shoe stretched out
391.02,392.85,",",well then once you stretch the shoe out
392.85,393.27,",",well then
393.27,394.59,.,the two corners
394.59,395.23,",",they go out
395.23,395.57,.,too
395.57,395.88,",",you know
395.88,396.9,?,okay your shoe's like this
396.9,397.96,",",you stretch this out
397.96,399.8,",",well then it's gonna make these go way out
399.8,399.98,",",too
399.98,400.94,?,and they get like this
400.94,401.15,.,right
400.94,402.66,",",then you have to round these back
402.66,403.31,?,you know
403.31,404.31,",",it's just
404.31,405.91,",",it s- it sounds easy
405.91,407.1,",",but it's really hard to do
407.1,407.49,",",and then
407.49,408.69,",",i would never do it
408.69,410.19,.,cause i'd never trust myself to do it
410.19,411.59,",",i mean we had to do it
411.59,411.91,",",but
411.91,414.7,",",it's just that people would volunteer their horses to the college
414.7,414.98,",",because
414.98,417.93,.,it costs like thirty bucks to get your horse shod
417.93,418.26,",",i mean
418.26,419.24,.,that's just how much it costs
419.24,420.64,",",could you imagine all those horses out there
420.64,421.5,?,if we had em all shod
421.78,422.69,.,how many have you got
421.78,422.98,",",thirty bucks
424.04,424.29,.,twenty
424.06,424.99,",",twenty-eight horses
424.99,425.41,?,you know
425.41,426.15,",",i mean
426.15,427.52,",",jesus
427.52,429.27,",",that would be a th- nine hundred dollars
429.27,430.17,.,just like that
430.17,430.51,",",i mean
430.51,431.26,?,could you imagine
431.26,431.92,",",so
431.92,433.7,",",w- you know
433.7,434.0,",",like
434.0,434.9,",",a lot of people
434.9,436.45,",",that have a lot of horses and stuff
436.45,437.71,",",and that they're riding a lot
437.71,438.21,",",they'll just
438.21,440.61,.,let the college kids do em
440.61,441.64,.,for em you know
441.64,443.12,",",they're taking the risk
443.12,445.62,",",of having their horse get lame
445.62,445.94,",",but
445.94,447.7,",",it really never happens
447.7,449.59,",",cause we have our s- instructor right there
449.59,450.19,",",telling us
450.19,450.85,.,this is what you do
450.85,451.8,",",and it's not like
451.8,453.51,",",there's a person that's just gung ho
453.51,454.16,",",and goes and just
454.16,455.91,",",trims their feet
455.91,456.96,",",and puts the shoe on
456.96,457.41,",",you know
457.41,459.16,.,you d- you d- you can't do that
459.16,460.63,",",and so we have our instructor right there
460.63,462.08,",",and we asked a million questions
462.08,462.98,",",all the time i mean
463.53,464.43,.,he just runs around
464.43,464.95,.,everywhere
464.95,465.53,.,you know
466.93,469.0,",",but uh
469.0,472.79,.,what was i gonna say
472.79,476.51,",",oh
476.51,477.67,.,and it's really tiring though
478.57,479.19,",",you know like
480.32,481.92,",",i've only done like
481.92,484.61,",",well
484.61,486.56,",",at the end of the year
486.56,486.91,",",now see
486.91,488.82,.,i took the second half of the course
488.82,489.82,",",and
489.82,491.52,",",right now
491.52,492.45,",",i've probably
492.45,494.05,",",only shod about
494.05,495.15,.,five horses
495.15,496.41,.,trimmed a lot of em
496.41,497.85,?,and you know what we start out with
497.85,499.63,.,this is the grossest of everything
497.85,498.29,.,what
499.63,501.07,",",we start out
501.07,501.93,",",with
501.93,503.74,.,dead horse hooves
503.74,505.06,",",i mean
505.06,505.66,",",you know
505.66,507.16,",",the the canneries
507.16,508.36,?,you know and stuff you know
510.15,512.16,?,kill the horses for meat and stuff
512.16,514.06,?,you know they have all these legs and stuff
514.96,515.86,",",i don't know
516.71,519.31,",",i thought they used the the horsehooves in for gelatin
519.31,520.06,?,that's not so
520.06,521.23,",",you know
521.23,521.97,",",i think they do
521.97,523.05,",",i think a lot of times
523.05,523.3,",",but
523.3,524.25,",",then they
525.91,527.12,.,i don't know what all they use em for
527.12,528.09,",",but anyway
528.09,530.12,",",we get these horse hooves
530.12,531.47,",",from this one cannery
532.42,533.2,",",they have to go
533.2,534.27,",",a long ways to go get em
534.27,535.29,",",like back east somewhere
535.29,536.8,.,to get these horse hooves
536.8,538.15,.,for the college
538.15,539.39,",",they go back east
539.39,540.01,.,and they get em
540.01,541.32,?,and they freeze em you know
541.32,543.29,",",so we have this frozen horse hoof
543.29,544.42,",",that we have to start out on
544.42,547.07,",",cause you don't want to cripple up a really good horse
547.07,547.37,",",and like
547.37,548.37,",",my first hoof
548.37,550.02,",",that horse would have been
550.02,550.92,",",lame
550.92,552.07,.,like crazy
552.07,552.87,",",but
552.87,553.82,",",it was just
553.82,554.04,",",and
554.04,554.36,",",oh
554.36,554.56,",",god
554.56,555.2,",",it's so gross
555.2,555.6,",",because
555.6,558.35,",",sometimes if you get one that's been thawed out a little bit
558.35,559.9,?,they start really stinking and stuff
559.9,560.2,",",oh
560.2,561.26,.,it's the grossest thing
561.26,561.72,",",oh
561.72,562.82,.,it's just so icky
562.82,563.27,",",i mean
567.7,568.86,",",i mean this leg that's
568.86,569.13,",",oh
569.13,569.75,.,it's just gross
569.75,571.1,?,and like in some of em
571.1,573.15,",",blood will spurt out
573.15,573.51,",",you know
573.51,574.04,",",and i mean
574.04,574.45,.,oh
575.59,577.34,.,it's the grossest thing
578.39,580.88,",",that's probably why they have to make that class mandatory
580.88,581.93,",",because at the beginning of the year
582.58,583.33,.,it's the pits
583.33,584.63,",",but once you get into it
584.63,585.88,",",it's the funnest thing and
585.88,586.16,",",you know
586.16,587.18,",",it's really interesting
587.18,588.43,.,to do stuff like that
588.43,589.27,",",but
589.27,591.67,",",i would have never got into that class
592.1,593.55,",",there's no way
593.55,594.51,",",if i didn't have to have it
594.51,595.16,.,there's no way
595.21,595.5,",",i mean
597.25,597.6,",",you know
597.6,599.4,",",like the people that took the class before
599.4,600.35,",",talking about
600.35,601.93,",",oh
601.95,602.89,",",you have to do this
602.89,603.62,",",you have to do that
603.62,604.92,",",there's dead horse hooves
604.92,605.71,",",you know you gotta
605.71,607.0,",",and they stink
607.0,607.86,",",and all this other stuff
607.86,608.51,",",and i was just going
608.51,609.65,",",oh my god
610.11,611.36,.,i don't want to take that class
611.36,612.55,",",so maybe i'll wait till next year
612.55,612.97,",",and then i thought
612.97,613.24,",",no
613.24,614.35,.,i'll get it out of the way now
614.35,616.25,",",and then once i got into it
616.25,616.48,",",geez
616.48,617.98,",",i wanna take the second half of it
617.98,619.5,",",it was just really interesting to me
619.5,619.96,?,you know
619.96,620.76,",",but
620.76,622.56,.,at first it was kind of a bummer
622.56,624.48,",",but
624.48,625.88,.,i'm glad i took it
625.88,626.78,.,really glad
626.78,629.27,.,it pays off
629.27,629.78,",",especially
629.78,630.15,",",you know
630.15,631.4,",",twelve bucks
631.4,632.06,.,for a trim
632.06,634.14,",",i mean that's twelve bucks
634.14,635.27,",",every time i can go out
635.27,636.92,.,and trim my own horse's hooves
636.97,637.34,.,right
636.92,637.7,",",you know
637.7,639.42,",",and i wouldn't trust myself to do it
639.42,639.92,",",with
639.92,641.56,",",a horse that i was really using a lot
641.56,642.06,",",or anything
642.06,643.81,",",but the ones that are standing around
643.81,646.82,",",that's still twelve dollars
646.82,647.09,",",you know
647.09,649.03,",",i mean whether the horse being used a lot or not
649.03,649.98,.,that's twelve bucks
649.98,650.19,",",and
650.19,651.25,",",shoot
651.25,652.15,",",i can do those
652.15,652.6,?,you know
652.6,654.85,",",but
654.85,655.69,",",i always have
656.28,658.96,",",i always have somebody that really knows what they're doing
658.96,660.96,.,for the horses that i'm really really using
660.96,668.44,",",but anyway
668.44,670.97,.,i wanna wait until the morning
670.97,671.77,.,to do that
671.77,672.42,",",because
672.42,673.66,",",it's just
673.66,675.31,",",too hot in the afternoon
675.31,676.31,.,to try to sit out there
676.31,677.31,",",i mean you can get
677.31,677.63,",",just
677.63,678.38,.,exhausted
678.38,678.86,",",anyway
680.11,680.75,",",the girl
680.75,681.0,",",you know
681.0,682.29,",",there isn't mary- very many
682.29,683.54,?,ferrier girls you know
683.9,684.35,?,that do this
684.35,685.85,.,this summer i met one
685.85,686.91,",",jorgensen's
686.91,689.69,",",they have one shoer
689.69,690.76,",",that comes to their house
690.76,691.35,",",all the time
691.35,692.92,.,they've had him for years and years and years
692.92,695.38,",",and i guess like in minnesota it's real wet
695.38,696.63,?,and stuff you know
696.63,697.28,",",so like
697.28,698.63,",",they really have to watch their shoes
698.63,699.36,",",for not coming off
699.36,700.36,",",because the hoof wall
700.36,701.45,.,is so much softer
701.45,701.93,",",it's like
701.93,702.48,",",when you're down there
702.48,704.18,",",your hands are softer and everything you know
704.18,705.61,?,and they're not as dry or anything
705.61,706.71,",",when you get back here
706.71,707.54,.,we have dry hooves
707.54,709.28,",",we have to watch out for like uh
709.28,711.78,.,like the hooves being too dry
711.78,713.32,.,we have to put ointment on em and stuff
713.67,715.11,.,back there they're too wet
715.11,716.43,",",not this time of the year
716.43,716.87,",",because
716.87,717.18,",",you know
717.18,717.97,",",they've had a dry year
717.97,718.1,",",but
718.1,719.6,",",usually they're too wet
720.15,722.41,",",that shoe can just pull right off
722.41,723.2,",",because it's just
723.2,725.31,.,the hoof wall is so soft
725.31,726.08,.,yeah
725.74,726.44,",",it seems weird
726.44,727.24,",",that that's like that
727.24,727.67,",",you know
728.17,728.87,",",i never knew that
728.87,729.95,",",until i took this class
729.95,730.21,.,either
731.46,731.97,",",you know
731.97,732.74,",",if you think about it
732.74,732.94,",",yeah

737.16,737.44,.,yeah
737.18,738.5,.,sure it's gonna be softer

741.25,743.3,.,you know that's kinda stuff too that you think about
743.3,744.45,",",but anyway
744.45,746.92,",",they always have this one horseshoer
